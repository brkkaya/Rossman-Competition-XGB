Rossman Data Science Competition

In this competition, I tried to predict future sales of the store based on the past evidence. 

Basically what I've done:

- Summary statistics to gain quick insight about the data.
- Reduce the data memory by changing variable types without losses information.
- Data visualization to understand the data behavior espacially the time series.
- Removing outliers and filling the null values by analytic intuition.
- Creating lag features 
- Mean encoding
- Creating feature which special for the data
- Training the model on gpu

Final output:

On train set RMSE score is : 0.06986
On validation set RMSE score is : 0.16691
